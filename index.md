# Final App - Weightlifting

For my final project I created a simple yet useful application geared towards people who like to workout and may want a rudimentary program that allows them to record their progress in a text file as they see fit. The input doesn't require any specific format mostly because what one person would want to record can be very different from the next.

The app also has a built in one rep max calculator, which takes the weight and amount of reps from a maximum effort set and uses a formula to predict what the most amount of weight you could lift is.

Then, finally, you can view the text file in the app without having to find the text file using the third function of the app.
